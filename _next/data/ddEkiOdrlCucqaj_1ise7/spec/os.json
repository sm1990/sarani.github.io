The released versions of the specification can be found under the relevant Github tag.\n\nIf you have any feedback or suggestions about the library, start a discussion via a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-standard-library/issues) or in the [Slack channel](https://ballerina.io/community/). Based on the outcome of the discussion, the specification and implementation can be updated. Community feedback is always welcome. Any accepted proposal, which affects the specification is stored under `/docs/proposals`. Proposals under discussion can be found with the label `type/proposal` in Github.\n\nThe conforming implementation of the specification is released and included in the distribution. Any deviation from the specification is considered a bug.\n\n## Contents\n\n1. [Overview](#1-overview)\n2. [Environment Variable Values](#2-environment-variable-values)\n3. [Operating System Users Information](#3-operating-system-users-information)\n\n## 1. Overview\nThis specification elaborates on the operating-system-related functions available in the OS library.\n\n## 2. Environment Variable Values\nThe environment variable value associated with a provided name can be retrieved using the `os:getEnv()` function.\n```ballerina\nstring port = os:getEnv(\"HTTP_PORT\");\n```\n\nAn environment variable can be set using the `setEnv` function.\n```ballerina\nos:Error? err = os:setEnv(\"BALCONFIGFILE\", \"/path/to/Config.toml\");\n```\n\nAn environment variable can be removed from the system using the `unsetEnv` function.\n```ballerina\nos:Error? err = os:unsetEnv(\"BALCONFIGFILE\");\n```\n\nThe existing environment variables of the system can be listed using the `listEnv` function.\n```ballerina\nmap<string> envs = os:listEnv();\n```\n\n## 3. Operating System Users Information\nThe current user's name can be retrieved using the `os:getUsername()` function.\n```ballerina\nstring username = os:getUsername();\n```\n\nThe current user's home directory path can be retrieved using the `os:getUserHome()` function.\n```ballerina\nstring userHome = os:getUserHome();\n```\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
